# ansible-playbook.sh - Gopherbot task for running an ansible playbook that uses
# a helper script for supplying a vault passphrase.

# How the sausage is made:
# - The 'ansible-playbook' task is configured with the 'ansible' namespace
# - The bot administrator supplies a vault passphrase with a DM to the robot:
#   `store parameter ansible:<some-repository> VAULT_PASSWORD=<some-passphrase>
# - Gopherbot supplies that value in the environment for the extended namespace
#   'ansible:<some-repository>', and the 'vault-password.sh' script just echo's
#   that value

export ANSIBLE_VAULT_PASSWORD_FILE=$GOPHER_CONFIGDIR/scripts/vault-password.sh
